!Series_summary	"Blood glucose levels are tightly controlled by the coordinated action of at least five cell types constituting pancreatic islets. Changes in the proportion and/or function of these cells are associated with genetic and molecular pathophysiology of monogenic, type 1, and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Cellular heterogeneity impedes precise understanding of the molecular components of each islet cell type that govern islet dysfunction, particularly the less abundant delta and gamma/pancreatic polypeptide (PP) cells. Here, we report single cell transcriptomes for 617 islet cells after profiling ~1000 cells from non-diabetic (ND) and T2D human organ donors. Analyses of non-diabetic single cell transcriptomes identified distinct alpha, beta, delta, and PP/gamma cell-type signatures. Genes linked to rare and common forms of islet dysfunction and diabetes were expressed in the delta and PP/gamma cell types. Moreover, this study revealed that delta cells specifically express receptors that receive and coordinate systemic cues from the leptin, ghrelin, and dopamine signaling pathways implicating them as integrators of central and peripheral metabolic signals into the pancreatic islet. Finally, single cell transcriptome profiling revealed genes differentially regulated between T2D and ND alpha, beta, and delta cells that were undetectable in paired whole islet analyses. This study thus identifies fundamental cell type-specific features of pancreatic islet (dys)function and provides a critical resource for comprehensive understanding of islet biology and diabetes pathogenesis."

Trimmed reads were mapped to human transcriptome (GRCh37, ensemble v70) using Bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012) and expression levels of all genes were estimated using RSEM (Li and Dewey, 2011). Transcript per million (TPM) values as defined by RSEM were added a value of 1 (to avoid zeros) prior to log2 transformation."	"Sequencing, Read Mapping, and Quality Control.

Briefly, reads with more than 30% of bases with quality scores were removed from the analysis and samples with more than 50% reads removed are removed from further analysis. Trimmed reads were mapped to human transcriptome (GRCh37, ensemble v70) using Bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012) and expression levels of all genes were estimated using RSEM (Li and Dewey, 2011). Transcript per million (TPM) values as defined by RSEM were added a value of 1 (to avoid zeros) prior to log2 transformation."	"Sequencing, Read Mapping, and Quality Control.

Trimmed reads were mapped to human transcriptome (GRCh37, ensemble v70) using Bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012) and expression levels of all genes were estimated using RSEM (Li and Dewey, 2011). Transcript per million (TPM) values as defined by RSEM were added a value of 1 (to avoid zeros) prior to log2 transformation."	"Sequencing, Read Mapping, and Quality Control.

Briefly, reads with more than 30% of bases with quality scores were removed from the analysis and samples with more than 50% reads removed are removed from further analysis. Trimmed reads were mapped to human transcriptome (GRCh37, ensemble v70) using Bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012) and expression levels of all genes were estimated using RSEM (Li and Dewey, 2011). Transcript per million (TPM) values as defined by RSEM were added a value of 1 (to avoid zeros) prior to log2 transformation."	"Sequencing, Read Mapping, and Quality Control.

Trimmed reads were mapped to human transcriptome (GRCh37, ensemble v70) using Bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012) and expression levels of all genes were estimated using RSEM (Li and Dewey, 2011). Transcript per million (TPM) values as defined by RSEM were added a value of 1 (to avoid zeros) prior to log2 transformation."	"Sequencing, Read Mapping, and Quality Control.

Briefly, reads with more than 30% of bases with quality scores were removed from the analysis and samples with more than 50% reads removed are removed from further analysis. Trimmed reads were mapped to human transcriptome (GRCh37, ensemble v70) using Bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012) and expression levels of all genes were estimated using RSEM (Li and Dewey, 2011). Transcript per million (TPM) values as defined by RSEM were added a value of 1 (to avoid zeros) prior to log2 transformation."	"Sequencing, Read Mapping, and Quality Control.

Therefore, Gaussian mixture modeling was fitted on a per gene basis using two mixture components to identify in which samples each gene was expressed. This Gaussian mixture modeling was performed using the R-package, mclust_5.2 (Fraley et al. 2016). Each single cell sample was classified as a specific pancreatic cell type if and only if a single gene from the selected marker gene list: INS (beta), GCG (alpha), SST (delta), PPY (gamma/PP), KRT19 (ductal), PRSS1 (acinar), and COL1A1 (stellate) was expressed in the sample and none of the other marker genes were expressed.

If more than one of these marker genes were expressed in a single cell, it was given the label  “multiple”. If none of the marker genes were expressed it was labeled as “none”."	"Islet Cell Type Classification. In general, density plots of marker gene expression in our samples portray a bimodal distribution.
