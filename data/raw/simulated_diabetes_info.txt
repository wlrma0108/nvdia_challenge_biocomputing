title: Simulated RNA Expression Data for Type 2 Diabetes Detection
description: 
        This is a simulated RNA expression dataset designed to mimic real diabetes biology.
        The dataset includes known diabetes-related genes with realistic differential expression
        patterns based on published literature.

        Key features:
        - 20,000 genes (probes)
        - 150 samples (75 control, 75 diabetes)
        - Blood tissue (whole blood)
        - Known diabetes biomarkers included
        - Realistic technical and biological variation
        - Batch effects included

        Known differentially expressed genes include:
        - Insulin signaling: INS, INSR, IRS1, IRS2, AKT2
        - Glucose metabolism: GCK, GLUT2, GLUT4, HK2
        - Inflammation: TNF, IL6, IL1B, NFKB1
        - Beta cell function: PDX1, NEUROD1
        - And many more...
