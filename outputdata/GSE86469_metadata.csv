Dissociated cells were measured in 300ul CMRL+10%FBS media on a Countess II FL (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to assess cell number and viability and diluted down to 300 cells/ul. Total processing and handling time for each islet was ≤60 minutes.",total RNA,"After capture cells were imaged within each capture nest with an EVOS FL Auto microscope (Life Technologies). IFCs were subsequently loaded with additional reagents for subsequent cell lysis, and SMARTer v1-based (Clontech), olio-(dT)-primed reverse transcription, template switching for second strand priming, and amplification of cDNA on the C1 System. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of all single cell cDNA products was performed on a 96 capillary Fragment Analyzer (Advanced Analytical). Only cell singlets, as determined by imaging, with adequate cDNA yield and quality were processed for subsequent sequencing. Fragmentation and tagmentation of cDNA was done with Nextera XT regarent (Illumina) using dual indices to prepare single-cell multiplexed libraries.",9606,"Supplementary_files_format_and_content: Comma-separated value file contains raw transcript per million (TPM) values of 26,616 protein coding and long non-coding RNAs.
